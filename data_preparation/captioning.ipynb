    "                            Please follow these precise instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "                            1. **Determine describability**: Assess whether this CAD model (as a whole) can be described using a short natural language caption. Do not describe individual views or interpret them as separate objects. Even if the model consists of multiple connected or adjacent parts, treat it as one entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "                            2. **Important note on views**:\n",
    "                            - The **top row** contains standard orthographic projections (e.g., front, top, side views). These provide reliable geometric clues such as length, thickness, angles, and symmetry. Use them as the primary reference for structure.\n",
    "                            - The lower rows show perspective views from various angles to supplement spatial understanding.\n",
    "                            - Do **not** mistakenly infer that multiple views indicate multiple separate objects. They are different renderings of the **same** CAD model.\n",
    "                            - Carefully observe small but important features such as through holes, indentations, internal cavities, or partial hollowness. These details matter in the description.\n",
    "\n",
    "                            3. **Perspective reasoning**: \n",
    "                            - Infer depth, flatness, holes, or slopes using the combination of orthographic and perspective views. Be cautious not to misinterpret shading or foreshortening.\n",
    "                            - Do not invent geometric features based on misleading perspective. For example, do not describe a cube as having a \"triangular\" or \"diamond-shaped\" face just because of viewing angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "                            4. **Output requirements**:\n",
    "                            - If the object has a clear, describable geometric or functional shape (e.g., \u201ca cylindrical rod with a flange\u201d,\"a water cup\"), set `isDescribable: true` and provide a concise description (1\u20132 lines max).\n",
    "                            - If the object appears abstract, highly irregular, or does not admit any concise description, set `isDescribable: false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "                            5.Common mistakes to avoid:\n",
    "                            - Misinterpreting perspective views as separate parts or separate objects.\n",
    "                            - Misclassifying flat rectangular plates or cubes as having diamond, triangular, pyramid, or prism-like shapes.\n",
    "                            - Ignoring holes or cutouts in discs, rods, or tapered parts.\n",
    "                            - Incorrectly assuming a part is completely solid or completely hollow without checking views.\n",
    "\n",
    "                            6. **Return the result strictly as a JSON object**, with no commentary or explanation. For example:\n",
